 RESTeasy doesn't output javax.xml.transform.Source,
 check why, e.g. https://github.com/resteasy/Resteasy/blob/master/jaxrs/resteasy-jaxrs/src/main/java/org/jboss/resteasy/plugins/providers/SourceProvider.java
 

Allow delete of complete patients via FHIR
e.g. DELETE [base]Patient

maybe also get a list of patients via GET [base]/Patient
